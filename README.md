# CSC440-Cryptology

Python, Java

Introduction to the methods of cryptography and cryptanalysis. Topics include classical cryptography (codes, monoalphabetic and polyalphabetic substitution ciphers, transposition ciphers), modern block ciphers (such as DES, AES), and public key cryptography (such as RSA). Optional topics include zero-knowledge protocols, information theory, coding theory, error-correcting codes, steganography, stream ciphers, hashing algorithms, quantum cryptography, elliptic curve cryptography, and history.
